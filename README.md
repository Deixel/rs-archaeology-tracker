Archaeology is a skill available in [RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com).
While training Archaeology, players collect Materials and Relics. Relics are initially in a broken state and must be repaired with a certain number of Materials before they can be used.
Once they have been repaired, Relics can be donated to Collectors in sets of Collections.

If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time keeping track of what Relics have already been found, repaired and donated as part of each Collection and subsequently how many Materials will be needed to repair the remaining Relics to complete a Collection.

Which is where this app comes in. It lets you track how many Damanged and Repaired relics you have, as well as which Relics have already been donated to a Collection. Once it knows that, it can accurately tell you exactly how many Materials you will need to find.
