Archaeology is a skill available in [RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com).
While training Archaeology, players collect Materials and Artefacts. Artefacts are initially in a broken state and must be repaired with a certain number of Materials before they can be used.
Once they have been repaired, Artefacts can be donated to Collectors in sets of Collections.

If you're anything like me, you'll have a hard time keeping track of what Artefacts have already been found, repaired and donated as part of each Collection and subsequently how many Materials will be needed to repair the remaining Artefacts to complete a Collection.

Which is where this app comes in. It lets you track how many Damanged and Repaired artefacts you have, as well as which Artefacts have already been donated to a Collection. Once it knows that, it can accurately tell you exactly how many Materials you will need to find.
